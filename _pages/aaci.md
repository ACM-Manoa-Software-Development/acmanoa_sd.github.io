### What is the purpose of AACI?
The purpose of AACI (pronounced like ASCII without the S) is for applying algorithms for competitions and coding interviews. We recognize that
Algorithms is an important foundation for many fields related to Computer Science, and for developing skills necessary to be successful in Computer Science, 
whether that be towards attaining a career after graduation, or simply to develop the intuition necessary for problem solving. 

### Who is welcome?
The group is open to all students who have and have not taken the ICS 311 on Algorithms. Students who have not taken ICS 311 are encouraged to have at least a basic knowledge of programming (knowledge corresponding to those having taken ICS 111), however, everyone is welcome to join. 

### What do we do?
For those who have yet to take Algorithms, AACI will be structured to follow the course curriculum of ICS 311, as one of our committee members will take on the duty of directing a simple review of the corresponding week of Algorithms to demonstrate how to apply the Algorithm to solving programming problems. To those who have taken ICS 311, we encourage you to join to solidify the knowledge learned from those classes for the purpose of improving yourself in interview practices or for competitions such as ICPC during the Fall, or Google Code Jam during the Spring.
