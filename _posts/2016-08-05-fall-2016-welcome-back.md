Hope you all had an enjoyable summer, we have a couple announcements and reminders going into the Fall semester.

___

There is a new Officer's board for the Fall 2016 - Spring 2017 Academic Year!

Here are your new officers:

{% for officer in site.data.officers %}
  **{{ officer.role }} -- {{ officer.name }} -- @{{ officer.slack_handle }}**
{% endfor %}


Also, ACM is migrating their Facebook presence from a Facebook group to a public facing Facebook page. If you are a part of the Facebook group bear in mind its use will be discontinued. Check out the new [ACManoa Page](https://www.facebook.com/ACM-Manoa-628133554020392/?fref=ts) and like it to get updates through Facebook.


As we approach the start of the new school year, make sure to check the Slack channel for additional announcements!
