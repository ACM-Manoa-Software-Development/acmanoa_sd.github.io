With the end of a school year comes a few changes. Together with ACManoa, we'd like to announce that we are merging the clubs together. We decided to do this because we deemed it was the most beneficial choice not just for the clubs, but also for the ICS community in general. 

There has been a lot of overlap in events/membership this past year, and it didn't really make sense to us to stay separate and have some events/things separate from both groups, as most opportunities given to the clubs were relevant to both of them.

We hope that this decision to centralize helps us give news to the entire ICS community, helping to keep everyone feel welcome and informed.

Thanks, and hope to see you all next year!
