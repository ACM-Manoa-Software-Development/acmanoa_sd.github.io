This site was built in Jekyll by the students of ACManoa. We forked a hand-crafted Jekyll theme called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and made extensive modifications to the structure in order to suit the needs of an RIO.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Friend')
#=> prints 'Hi, Friend' to STDOUT.
```
