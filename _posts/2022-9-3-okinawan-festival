## Come Join us at the Okinawan Festival!

Started in 1982 by the Hawaii United Okinawa Association, the Okinawan Festival celebrates all things Okinawan and brings together Okinawans and Okinawans-at-heart. Our theme of "Sharing Uchinanchu Aloha" is embedded in everything we do.  Join us for the ono food, beautiful performances, educational cultural exhibits and much more.

ACM is looking to support the Okinawan festival on Saturday September 3rd & Sunday September 4th this year at the Hawaii Convention Center. The Okinawan Festival is one of Hawaii's largest ethnic festivals. This will be a good volunteering opportunity to show your support for Hawaii's community and showing awareness of cultural diversity. 

If you are interested in coming out to help, please fill out the google signup form by Wednesday AUG 31 @ 11:59PM:

We are looking forward to seeing you!

Thanks!
