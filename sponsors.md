## Sponsors!

We'd love to work with you on our next event! Here's a few ideas on how you can support ACManoa:
- Donate towards one of our next social events (advertising will include company name/logo)
- Give a showcase/tour of your company
- Hold a lunch/dinner with a tech talk or informal information session
- Suggest something! We're always open to new ideas
